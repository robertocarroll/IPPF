IPPF made an unprecedented commitment to treble the number of sexual and reproductive health services provided by 2020, through a comprehensive package of rights-based services including a range of contraceptive methods and safe abortion.\nWe also made a commitment to scale up our advocacy by establishing civil society networks in the poorest countries to hold governments accountable for providing services for women and girls, committing financial resources, and ensuring a range of contraceptives are included on the National Essential Medicines List.\n\nIPPF garnered the support of 1300 civil society organizations who signed up to IPPF's declaration. This was then sent to the UK Prime Minister and Melinda Gates, and was published in the Financial Times.\n\nAfter the conference IPPF’s Director-General was invited to participate in the Reference Group for Family Planning 2020. This group was a key outcome of the summit and will be responsible for providing strategic direction and coordination between partners to improve women’s and girls’ access to contraception. The group will track resources and results, ensuring that the US$2.6 billion committed at the summit is implemented according to internationally agreed standards and responds to the needs of national priorities.\n\n",
